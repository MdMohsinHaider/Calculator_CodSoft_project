To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an
interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize
CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and
loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be
done with basic knowledge of these technologies..

## Basic Calculator
This is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
User-friendly interface with responsive design.
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear button for resetting the input and results.
Interactive buttons for user input.

## Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript

## Project Structure
index.html: Contains the structure of the calculator interface.
style.css: Defines the styles for the calculator using CSS.
script.js: Implements the functionality and logic of the calculator using JavaScript.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MdMohsinHaider/Calculator_project.git
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

3. Start performing calculations using the interactive buttons.

## Calculator Interface
The calculator interface consists of a display screen for showing user input and results, along with buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and operations (+, -, *, /). There is also a clear button to reset the input and results.

The CSS grid system is utilized for proper alignment and responsiveness of the calculator buttons.

## Implementation Details
The JavaScript code uses event listeners to capture user clicks on the calculator buttons. It then handles user input, performs the corresponding calculations, and updates the display accordingly. The code includes if-else statements for differentiating between digit buttons, operator buttons, and the clear button.
